# Welcome to the afab_course_submissions_ws2019

Please upload your assignment's solution until the submission deadlines.

How to submit:
- Clone the repository (afab_course_submissions_ws2019) in github desktop to your workspace/projects folder
- The easiest way to set up your folder structure is when you open your new repository in Visual Studio Code or open it in your explorer (\workspace\projects\afab_course_submissions_ws2019).

- Create **one** folder with **your name**, labeled: 
    first name_last name (or copy the sample folder and insert your name)
    Create a new sub-folder and place your submissions in it

When you are done, go back on github desktop, commit to master and press -repository-, -pull- to upload your submission.

Many thanks!
